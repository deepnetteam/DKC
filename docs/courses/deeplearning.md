Deep learning courses - the list
======================================

This is a comprehensive list of courses to learn deep learning, from theory to implementation. Courses are sorted following their medium, for example MOOC, online videos, readings, books, etc...

- **[Deep learning by 3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)**:  
![code](https://img.shields.io/badge/content-video-blue.svg?logo=youtube "Video")  
4 introduction videos of neural network by the excellent 3Blue1Brown. The entire playlist can be binged-watched in an hour for building an intuition and understanding of deep learning.


- **[MXNet Getting started](http://gluon.mxnet.io/chapter02_supervised-learning/linear-regression-scratch.html)**:

![code](https://img.shields.io/badge/code-intermediate-yellow.svg?logo=python "Intermediate")  
Much more practical than the other courses, there are still (skippable) mathematical proofs. Expect a good amount of explanations and coding, often from scratch and using Gluon to speed things up.

![code](https://img.shields.io/badge/content-video-green.svg "MOOC") 
![code](https://img.shields.io/badge/code-intermediate-yellow.svg?logo=python "Intermediate")  
Recognized as the reference course on deep learning. Goes from theory, to implementation using librairies, and through everything in between. The MOOC format can be followed for an expected 2h work a week, but videos are freely accessible on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS4cs9xVecg&list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0).


- **[CS231n Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfnWJUyUJYU&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC)**:

Stanford lectures of *Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition*. Videos are theoretical, but assignments are available through their [website](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/). Each video is 1h15 long, but worth your while. This is the 2016 Winter session by Andrej Karpathy.
